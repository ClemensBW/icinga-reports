Icinga Reporting Java module
----------------------------

Icinga Reporting requires a Java module with some helper functions for
calculating date and timestamps.

In this directory you will find the source code of this class and a Makefile
to compile the jar.

You will need a Java SDK for that, OpenJDK will be fine.

In our distributions the jar file should be included ready to use.
